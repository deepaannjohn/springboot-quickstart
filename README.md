# springboot-quickstart
the default springboot project generated using the spring.io or IDE

Run the project using 

./gradlew bootRun on Mac

and .\gradlew.bat bootRun on Windows

This does not do much. This is the standard boilerplate code. 

On http://localhost:8080 the Tomcat server runs on running the above command.
